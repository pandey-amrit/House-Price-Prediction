# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on various features. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using Python. 

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Missing value imputation, feature engineering, and data transformation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and evaluates Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regressors.
- **Pipeline Design**: Includes a fully functional preprocessing and modeling pipeline using `sklearn`.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Employs GridSearchCV for fine-tuning the best-performing model.
- **Performance Metrics**: Reports RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² for model evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Provides feature importance visualization for tree-based models.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- OpenPyXL for handling Excel data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place your dataset in the project directory (`HousePricePrediction.xlsx` as default).
3. Run the `HousePricePrediction.py` script to train models and view results.
